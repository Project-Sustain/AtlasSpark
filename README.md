# atlas-spark-sql
## OVERVIEW
Spatio-temporal spark implementation with optimizations for reading dataframes from Atlas.

## DATAFRAME OPERATIONS
- group_by: spatial / time
- polygons: sifting operator -> filtering on a particular constraint
- set: intersection, union, distinct
- sampling: uniform sampling, stratified sampling (at least 50 observations from everything)
- merging datasets: epa and noaa -> tollerances between datasets
- joins: what does a join look like in this system

## TODO
- everything
